Whistler Daily Snowfall (from http://www.mldata.org/repository/data/viewslug/whistler-daily-snowfall/)

Historical daily snowfall data in Whistler, BC, Canada over the period July 1 1972 to December 31 2009. Measured at top of Whistler Gondola: Latitude: 50°04'04.000" N Longitude: 122°56'50.000" W Elevation: 1835.00 m 

Two attributes were selected: 
X = MeanTemp (deg Celsius)
Y = TotalSnow (cm)

Common sense tells us that X causes Y (with maybe very small feedback of Y on X). Confounders are present (e.g., day of the year).

X-->Y
