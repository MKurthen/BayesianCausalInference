Information for pair 98
 
natural logarithm of employment and natural logarithm of population 
 
data for 3102 counties in US in 1980.  
 
The data were taken from US county-level growth data set from Journal of Applied Econometrics web site.  Currently available at
http://www.spatial-econometrics.com/data/contents.html .
 
x (first column): the natural logarithm of employment in 1980 in 3102 counties in US;
y (second column): the natural logorithm of the corresponding population.

It seems reanable that the total population causes the employment, not vice versa. The difference (x-y) can be considered as the natural logarithm of the propotion of the emloyment.

Ground truth:
y --> x
