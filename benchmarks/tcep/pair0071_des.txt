Acute inflammation of urinary bladder is characterised
by sudden occurrence of pains in the abdomen region and the urination in form of
constant urine pushing, micturition pains and sometimes lack of urine keeping.
Temperature of the body is rising, however most often not above 38C. The excreted
urine is turbid and sometimes bloody. At proper treatment, symptoms decay usually
within several days. However, there is inclination to returns. At persons with acute
inflammation of urinary bladder, we should expect that the illness will turn into
protracted form.

Acute nephritis of renal pelvis origin occurs considerably more often at women than at
men. It begins with sudden fever, which reaches, and sometimes exceeds 40C. The fever
is accompanied by shivers and one- or both-side lumbar pains, which are sometimes very
strong. Symptoms of acute inflammation of urinary bladder appear very often. Quite not
infrequently there are nausea and vomiting and spread pains of whole abdomen.

The data was created by a medical expert as a data set to test the expert system, which
will perform the presumptive diagnosis of two diseases of urinary system. 
Each instance represents an potential patient. 

Discrete and logical data:
1 = yes, 2 = no

X is 6-dimensional
1 	Temperature of patient { 35C-42C } 
2 	Occurrence of nausea 
3 	Lumbar pain
4 	Urine pushing (continuous need for urination)
5 	Micturition pains
6 	Burning of urethra, itch, swelling of urethra outlet

Y is 2-dimensional
7	decision: Inflammation of urinary bladder
8 	decision: Nephritis of renal pelvis origin
