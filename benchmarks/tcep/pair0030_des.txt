Concrete Compressive Strength 

---------------------------------

Abstract: Concrete is the most important material in civil engineering. The 
concrete compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function of age and 
ingredients. These ingredients include cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, 
water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, and fine aggregate.
