- Response of NEP on PPFDdif

First column (x): NEP (Net Ecosystem Productivity)
- a measure of the carbon flux
- calculated by photosynthetic uptake MINUS release by respiration
- is known to be driven by PPFDdif and PPFDdir
- unit: [?mol/(m?s)]

Second column (y): PPFDdif (Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density, diffusive)
- a measure of light intensity in terms of diffusive photons, that are available for photosynthesis
- i.e. the number of diffusive photons falling on a 1 meter square area per second
- only the photons with a wavelength of 400-700nm (visible light) are available for photosynthesis
- unit [?mol/(m?s)]
PPFD(total) = PPFDdif + PPFDdir
