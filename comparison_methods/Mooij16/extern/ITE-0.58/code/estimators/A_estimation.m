function [A] = A_estimation(Y,ds,co)
%function [A] = A_estimation(Y,ds,co)
%Estimates association measure A(y^1,...,y^M), where the m^th subspace is ds(m)-dimensional; using the method/cost object co.
%
%INPUT:
%   Y: Y(:,t) is the t^th sample.
%  ds: subspace dimensions. ds(m) = dimension of the m^th subspace, m=1,...,M (M=length(ds)).
%  co: association measure estimator object (structure).
