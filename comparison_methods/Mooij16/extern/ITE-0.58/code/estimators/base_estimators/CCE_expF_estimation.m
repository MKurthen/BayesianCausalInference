function [CE] = CCE_expF_estimation(Y1,Y2,co)
%function [CE] = CCE_expF_estimation(Y1,Y2,co)
%Estimates the cross-entropy (CE) of Y1 and Y2 using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) + analytical formula associated to the chosen exponential family.
%Assumption: k, the carrier measure is zero.
%
%We use the naming convention 'C<name>_estimation' to ease embedding new cross quantity estimation methods.
%
%INPUT:
%  Y1: Y1(:,t) is the t^th sample from the first distribution.
%  Y2: Y2(:,t) is the t^th sample from the second distribution. Note: the number of samples in Y1 [=size(Y1,2)] and Y2 [=size(Y2,2)] can be different.
%  co: cross quantity estimator object.

%co.mult:OK. The information theoretical quantity of interest can be (and is!) estimated exactly [co.mult=1]; the computational complexity of the estimation is essentially the same as that of the 'up to multiplicative constant' case [co.mult=0]. In other words, the estimation is carried out 'exactly' (instead of up to 'proportionality').
