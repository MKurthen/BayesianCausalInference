function [co] = IShannon_AP2_initialization(mult)
%function [co] = IShannon_AP2_initialization(mult)
%Initialization of the adaptive partitioning based Shannon mutual information estimator; specialization to 2 components.
%
%Note:
%   1)The estimator is treated as a cost object (co).
%   2)We use the naming convention 'I<name>_initialization' to ease embedding new mutual information estimation methods.
%
%INPUT:
%   mult: is a multiplicative constant relevant (needed) in the estimation; '=1' means yes (='exact' estimation), '=0' no (=estimation up to 'proportionality').
%   post_init: {field_name1,field_value1,field_name2,field_value2,...}; cell array containing the names and the values of the cost object fields that are to be used
%   (instead of their default values). For further details, see 'post_initialization.m'.
%OUTPUT:
%   co: cost object (structure).
