function [co] = ABlomqvist_initialization(mult)
%function [co] = ABlomqvist_initialization(mult)
%Initialization of the estimator of the multivariate extension of Blomqvist's beta (medial correlation coefficient).
%
%Note:
%   1)The estimator is treated as a cost object (co).
%   2)We use the naming convention 'A<name>_initialization' to ease embedding new association estimator methods.
%
%INPUT:
%   mult: is a multiplicative constant relevant (needed) in the estimation; '=1' means yes (='exact' estimation), '=0' no (=estimation up to 'proportionality').
%OUTPUT:
%   co: cost object (structure).
