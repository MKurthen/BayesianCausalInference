function [I] = IShannon_AP_estimation(Y,ds,co)
%function [I] = IShannon_AP_estimation(Y,ds,co)
%Estimates the Shannon mutual information (I) using adaptive partitioning. 
%
%We use the naming convention 'I<name>_estimation' to ease embedding new mutual information estimation methods.
%
%INPUT:
%   Y: Y(:,t) is the t^th sample.
%  ds: subspace dimensions. ds(m) = dimension of the m^th subspace, m=1,...,M (M=length(ds)).
%  co: mutual information estimator object.

%co.mult:OK. The information theoretical quantity of interest can be (and is!) estimated exactly [co.mult=1]; the computational complexity of the estimation is essentially the same as that of the 'up to multiplicative constant' case [co.mult=0]. In other words, the estimation is carried out 'exactly' (instead of up to 'proportionality').
