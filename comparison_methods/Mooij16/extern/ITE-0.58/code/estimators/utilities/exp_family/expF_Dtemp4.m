function [Dtemp4] = expF_Dtemp4(distr,np1,np2,a,b)
%function [Dtemp4] = expF_Dtemp4(distr,np1,np2,a,b)
%Computes Dtemp4 = \int [f_1(u)]^a [f_2(u)]^b du in the chosen exponential family (distr), where np1 and np2 are the natural parameters associated to f_1 and f_2, respectively.
%Assumption: a + b = 1 and 'a * np1 + b * np2' belongs to the natural space. This holds, for example, if the natural space is affine.
