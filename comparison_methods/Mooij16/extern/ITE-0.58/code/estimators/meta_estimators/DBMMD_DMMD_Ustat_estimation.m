function [D] = DBMMD_DMMD_Ustat_estimation(Y1,Y2,co)
%function [D] = DBMMD_DMMD_Ustat_estimation(Y1,Y2,co)
%Estimates divergence (D) of Y1 and Y2 using the MMD (maximum mean discrepancy) method, average of U-statistics, i.e., the samples are partitioned into blocks ('B').
%
%Note:
%   1)We use the naming convention 'D<name>_estimation' to ease embedding new divergence estimation methods.
%   2)This is a meta method: the U-statistics based MMD estimator can be arbitrary.
%
%INPUT:
%  Y1: Y1(:,t) is the t^th sample from the first distribution.
%  Y2: Y2(:,t) is the t^th sample from the second distribution.
%  co: divergence estimator object.

%co.mult:OK. The information theoretical quantity of interest can be (and is!) estimated exactly [co.mult=1]; the computational complexity of the estimation is essentially the same as that of the 'up to multiplicative constant' case [co.mult=0]. In other words, the estimation is carried out 'exactly' (instead of up to 'proportionality').
