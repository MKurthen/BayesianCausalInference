This package contains the entropy estimator described in 

    D. Stowell and M. D. Plumbley
    Fast multidimensional entropy estimation by k-d partitioning.
    IEEE Signal Processing Letters 16 (6), 537--540, June 2009.

The estimator is written in C and so should be easily usable in any C/C++
software, as well as in other languages that can call upon C.

This package also contains wrappers which allow the code to be used from
Matlab, GNU Octave, or Python (numpy).
