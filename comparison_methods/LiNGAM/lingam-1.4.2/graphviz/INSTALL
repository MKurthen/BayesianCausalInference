INSTALL

This file includes short instructions for installing Graphviz
from the files distributed in this directory. See www.graphviz.org
for more information on Graphviz.


Mac OS X
--------

System requirements: Mac OS 10.2 or later.

1) Install Graphviz from 'graphviz-1.13-v16.dmg':

   1.1) Open 'graphviz-1.13-v16.dmg' by double-clicking it.
   1.2) Drag the contents to your preferred folder.

2) Add [YourGraphvizFolder]/Graphviz.app/Contents/MacOS/ to your PATH
   environment variable. Example (bash shell):

     export PATH=$PATH:[YourGraphvizFolder]/Graphviz.app/Contents/MacOS/


Linux
-----

Graphviz should compile nicely with most Linux distributions,
so we recommend compiling the latest stable sources available
from www.graphviz.org.

We also distribute the latest stable sources at the time
of this writing (graphviz-2.6.tar.gz / Sep 2005).

1) Install Graphviz from graphviz-2.6.tar.gz. For example, to
   install Graphviz under directory [YourInstallRoot], type
   the following commands:

     tar xzvf graphviz-2.6.tar.gz
     cd graphviz-2.6
     ./configure --prefix=[YourInstallRoot]
     make
     make install

2) Add [YourInstallRoot]/bin to your PATH environment variable.
   Example (bash shell):

     export PATH=$PATH:[YourInstallRoot]/bin


Windows
-------

The Windows installation has not been tested, but the installation
should proceed as follows:

1) Install Graphviz with 'graphviz-2.6.exe'.
2) Add the Graphviz executables to your PATH environment variable.
